# Features

- Sort by "signature".
- Filter by byte size.
- Filter by image width & height.
- When selection is multiple, show number of files and total bytes instead of single file info.
- Go from a folder view to another using alt+arrows.
- Use letters to jump to files.

# Bugs

- Current image index after file delete should be set to "next to last deleted image", not "last image in the folder".
- Long file names are not handled correctly.

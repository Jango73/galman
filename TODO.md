# Bugs that IA won't fix, no matter how many tries. Needs human brain work.

- When leaving image display, clicking on an item will not select it, a second click must be done for this. After that, everything works as expected. This happens with the first click just after leaving a display view, in normal and sync mode. It is probably related to the focus not changing on the first click.

- When in sync mode with folders that have a lot of differences, the selected item displays (sometimes) two overlayed names.

# Bugs

- Current image index after file delete should be set to "next to last deleted image", not "last image in the folder".
- Long file names like "18835477-0e7f272a-94bd-4da7-b6f5-1547cb0edcce.mp4" are not displayed correctly, they tend to spill over neighbors. Make sure ellipsis are shown as soon as the name exceeds 20 chars. Also put ellipsis in the name displayed on the command panel.
- Remove rubber band selector.
- A "ghost" file should not have a date displayed.

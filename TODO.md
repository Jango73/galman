- When leaving image display, clicking on an item will not active it, a second click must be done for this. After that, everything works as exptected. This happens with the first click just after leaving a display view, in normal and sync mode.
- The contextual menu is not placed next to the related item, it is off in x by more than an item's size and in y by an item's size.
